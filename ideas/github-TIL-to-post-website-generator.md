# github-TIL-to-post-website-generator
### By Gontran Sion, the 2021-02-03.

The goal here is to sync my today-i-learned github repo with my website to extract post of the repo, and publish/edit them from the website admin editor,
so the website can commit post in md file format in the TIL repo, and generate a database of post from this repo for the website.

([Website repo](https://github.com/onsimini/onsimini-website)  -- 
[Website](https://www.onsimini.com))

 - [x] git access from the website
 - [x] list all files and folder in TIL
 - [x] generate README.MD
 - [ ] post extraction in db
 - [ ] admin page
    - [ ] login
    - [ ] post new post
    - [ ] edit existing post
    - [ ] ...
 - [ ] ...
